Overall, the project is moderate difficulty, there are hard questions and easy questions.
Google app sheet was easy to use as its UI is clean and everything was structured.
Microsoft power apps was not easy to use, It took me a lot of time to find the actual page of Sample apps, and using a sample apps requires more steps than Google App sheet, but 
it seems like some of the Microsoft Power Apps have much functionality than Google apps.
Defining the scenrio was not too hard since all of us have different ideas and thoughts on what app we going to build, after discussion, we pick the one that most related to our 
daily life since we believe that our own experiences would help us in other part of the project. 
However, writing the emphasize and define was bit difficuly than previous part, as we need to combine our thoughts into one paragraph while using the knowledge from the course, 
this part took majority of our collaboration time, and we did end-up satisfy our work.
While doing the emphasize/define part, it did inspired and remind me that when designing a project, it have to be excatly relate to the end-users, what they need and what they 
want is the key factor that determin the result of the project.
