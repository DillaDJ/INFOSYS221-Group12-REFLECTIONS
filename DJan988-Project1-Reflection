This assignment had some easy parts and some difficult parts, reviewing Google Powerapps was relatively easy due to the accessability of the sample apps.
Microsoft Powerapps on the other hand was the oppisite where it was tedious and difficult to set up, getting 2 apps to even work was a challenge.

We chose a problem that was a bit closer to home as students so we could easily connect with and identify the problems that students have.
Aside from problem of Microsoft Powerapps, it didn't take too long and we were decently prepared when going through the emphasize stage.

I'd say that section was just the right difficulty as we had parts where we were having trouble but we got over it with enough thinking on the problem.
I think we could know a little bit more of the define section as all we had to do was write two HMW questions, 
it kind of completed itself compared to the other sections.
